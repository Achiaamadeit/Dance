  <br><h2>2️⃣0️⃣2️⃣0️⃣-2️⃣0️⃣2️⃣2️⃣</h2>We mostly performed at church programs and musical events.
     We dance to celebrate, worship, and praise God through the leading of the Holy Spirit. Movement has power to stir the senses and emotions and convey a message
      that cannot be expressed through words alone, so our ministry interprets selected songs to express God's messages to His people.
